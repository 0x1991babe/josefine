//! This implementation of the [Raft](raft.github.io) consensus algorithm forms the basis for safely
//! replicating state in the distributed commit log. Raft is used to elect a leader that coordinates
//! replication across the cluster and ensures that logs are written to a quorom of followers before
//! applying that log to the committed index.
//!
//! This implementation is developed as an agnostic library that could be used for other
//! applications, and does not reference concerns specfic to the distributed log implementation.
//! Raft is itself a commit log and tracks its state in a manner that is somewhat similar to the
//! Kafka reference implementation for Josefine.
